# Configuring HttpRouter adapters

`HttpRouter` is adapter-based: it delegates URL pattern matching to a Hono `Router` instance. Any existing Hono-compatible adapter can be used interchangeably with the `HttpRouter` class.

## SmartRouter

`SmartRouter` is the recommended adapter. It composes multiple routers and automatically selects the best matching router for each route.

`eridu-tech/http-router` exports [`defaultHttpRouterAdapter`](https://eridu-tech.github.io/eridu-tech-core/variables/HttpRouter.defaultHttpRouterAdapter.html) to reduce boilerplate. It is equivalent to:

```ts file=./samples/smart-router-default-equivalent.ts

```

```ts file=./samples/smart-router-default.ts

```

You can also configure `SmartRouter` explicitly:

```ts file=./samples/smart-router-explicit.ts

```

:::info
`SmartRouter` provides the best all-around performance by delegating each route to the optimal underlying router. Prefer it unless you have a specific reason to use a single router.

## RegExpRouter

`RegExpRouter` compiles all routes into a single regular expression for fast matching. It is best suited for applications with many static routes.

```ts file=./samples/regexp-router.ts

```

## TrieRouter

`TrieRouter` performs linear trie traversal for route matching. It is best suited for applications with many dynamic path parameters.

```ts file=./samples/trie-router.ts

```

## LinearRouter

`LinearRouter` registers routes very quickly, making it suitable for environments that initialize applications on every request.

```ts file=./samples/linear-router.ts

```

## PatternRouter

`PatternRouter` is the smallest router, simply adding and matching patterns. It is best suited for minimal footprint applications.

```ts file=./samples/pattern-router.ts

```
