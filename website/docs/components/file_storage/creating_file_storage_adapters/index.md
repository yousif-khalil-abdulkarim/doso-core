# Creating FileStorage adapters

## Implementing your custom IFileStorageAdapter

In order to create an adapter you need to implement the [`IFileStorageAdapter`](https://eridu-tech.github.io/eridu-tech-core/types/file-storage.IFileStorageAdapter.html) contract.

## Implementing your custom ISignedFileStorageAdapter

We provide an additional contract [`ISignedFileStorageAdapter`](https://eridu-tech.github.io/eridu-tech-core/types/FileStorage.ISignedFileStorageAdapter.html) for building custom FileStorage adapters with support for creating signed download and upload urls.

## Implementing your custom IFileStorage class

In some cases, you may need to implement a custom [`FileStorage`](https://eridu-tech.github.io/eridu-tech-core/classes/file-storage.FileStorage.html) class to optimize performance for your specific technology stack. You can then directly implement the [`IFileStorage`](https://eridu-tech.github.io/eridu-tech-core/types/file-storage.IFileStorage.html) contract.
