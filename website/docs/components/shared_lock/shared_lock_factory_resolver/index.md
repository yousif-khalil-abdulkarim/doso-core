# SharedLockFactoryResolver

The `SharedLockFactoryResolver` class provides a flexible way to configure and switch between different shared-lock adapters at runtime.

## Initial configuration

To begin using the `ISharedLockFactoryResolver`, you will need to register all required adapters during initialization.

```ts file=./samples/shared-lock-factory-resolver-initial-config.ts

```

## Usage

### 1. Using the default adapter

```ts file=./samples/shared-lock-factory-resolver-default-adapter.ts

```

:::danger
Note that if you dont set a default adapter, an error will be thrown.
:::

### 2. Specifying an adapter explicitly

```ts file=./samples/shared-lock-factory-resolver-specific-adapter.ts

```

:::danger
Note that if you specify a non-existent adapter, an error will be thrown.
:::

### 3. Overriding default settings

```ts file=./samples/shared-lock-factory-resolver-override-settings.ts

```

:::info
Note that the `SharedLockFactoryResolver` is immutable, meaning any configuration override returns a new instance rather than modifying the existing one.
